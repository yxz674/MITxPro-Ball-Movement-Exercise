# MITxPro-Ball-Movement-Exercise

This is Ball Movement Exercise Repo for MITxPro Bootcamp's Github Portfolio Project. This exercise is to create and display a ball on the web page. The ball will continuously move from left to right, then reverse its direction when it hit the edge.

# How to Run:

The ball on the page will run automatically.

# Roadmap of Future Improvements

I am planning to work on: 1. changing the direction of ball's movement on the page. 2. adding a button to create more balls, each ball will move randomly across the screen.
